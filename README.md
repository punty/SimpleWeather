# SimpleWeather
Simple app for coding challenge

App created using MVVM
Using stackview and collection view for the layout
It would benefit from RxSwift or any other reactive framework (for an example look at this https://github.com/punty/SimpleApp )
For time limit I just wrote some simple unit test, but I tried to create an app that is fully testable
No logic in the view controllers
Separated layer for networking
